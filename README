An external class has been implemented in this project. This has to be imported by setting classpath. I have used eclipse to import the external class. 
The external class has been imported from the project JLayer. The "Player" class used from the project can be found online. 

SET THE CLASSPATH BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT.
